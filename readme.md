# FBKAL

a site for the fantasy basketball keepers auction league. specifically the one i'm a part of, which we call FBKAL

# todo

- style up tables as like a default before steph's design since these gatsby defaults don't work for my needs at all
- move airtable API key to process.env so that it's hidden
- style table to match steph's design
- links to each team's individual keepers page on the keepers page
- make header navigation function like:
  1. FBKAL (homepage)
  2. FBKAL / Keepers (keepers page)
  3. FBKAL / Keepers / Bird Rights (bird-rights keepers page)
the header becomes a dynamic path. i just like the idea so much
