# FBKAL

a site for the fantasy basketball keepers auction league. specifically the one i'm a part of, which we call FBKAL

## update log

- airtable data updated: monday 2019.10.7 9:33am MT

## todo

- allow sorting and sort by CTK by default both keepers and each team's individual keeper page
- links to each team's individual keepers page on the keepers page
- style table to match steph's design
- make header navigation function like:
  1. FBKAL (homepage)
  2. FBKAL / Keepers (keepers page)
  3. FBKAL / Keepers / Bird Rights (bird-rights keepers page)
the header becomes a dynamic path. i just like the idea so much
- figure out what to do with the homepage. maybe it should just be the keepers page. maybe it should be a blog roll of the stuff that's currently in the announcements channel in the fbkal slack
  - setup the homepage as a feed of announcements (html versions of alan's docs (with links to download the associated file), trade announcements, etc...)
